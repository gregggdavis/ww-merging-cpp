Dear Mr. Frans Hendrick:

I thank you very much for your kind letter of [Date], in which you asked me to send to you brochures on our newest products.

I sent your letter to Europe office, and they will take care of it.

I will not send you the price lists, however.  Go to one of our retailers for that information.

Respectfully yours,
